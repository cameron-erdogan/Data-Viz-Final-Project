# Data-Viz-Final-Project

Code: 

Everything is in the full_site folder.

For external code, we use the d3 library (for all the visualizations) and the select2 (for our dropdown menu stylings). Both of these are referenced in index.html and are loaded from a url. 

Data: 

The data is compiled located in full_site/data/All-The-Data.csv. This is a consolidated file of primarily World Happiness Report data, but also of country population and continent.
